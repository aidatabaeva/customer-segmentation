# Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a crucial exercise for many businesses. It enables companies to better understand customers’ needs, deliver targeted differentiated messaging, communicate via appropriate channels, and optimize marketing spend. With the amount of data companies collect about their customers these days it’s hard to naturally identify segments. Here machine learning comes into play with powerful unsupervised learning techniques, such as Clustering. In this project, I am describing the step-by-step process of a Customer Segmentation analysis and how it can be effective in building customer personas. I am also addressing the data manipulation and pre-processing needs that enable more effective data analysis.

### Data
My dataset contains 2,240 observations and 29 features with various information about a retail company’s customers, including demographic data, such as year of birth, education, marital status, income; product purchase data; promotional data and customer reaction to it; and customer behavior data, e.g. where they typically buy from.

### Research Question to Answer
- What are the key target market segments?
- What are their purchase behavior patterns?
- What’s the best way to communicate with them?
- What is the most profitable segment?

### Summarized Steps
