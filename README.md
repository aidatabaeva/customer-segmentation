# Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a crucial exercise for many businesses. It enables companies to better understand customers’ needs, deliver targeted differentiated messaging, communicate via appropriate channels, and optimize marketing spend. With the amount of data companies collect about their customers these days it’s hard to naturally identify segments. Here machine learning comes into play with powerful unsupervised learning techniques, such as Clustering. In this project, I am describing the step-by-step process of a Customer Segmentation analysis and how it can be effective in building customer personas. I am also addressing the data manipulation and pre-processing needs that enable more effective data analysis.


### Data
My dataset contains various information about retail company customers, including demographic data, purchase data, promotional data, and customer behavior data.


### Research Question to Answer
- What are the key target market segments?
- What are their purchase behavior patterns?
- What’s the best way to communicate with them?
- What is the most profitable segment?


### Summarized Approach

### Results
As a result of this project, I have derived three distinct customer clusters, each with its similarities and differences. In marketing analysis, creating personas is a common practice to interpret and profile customer segments. After a thorough analysis of each cluster, I have created three personas describing each respective segment.
