# Customer Segmentaion
Customer Segmentation is a crucial exercise for many businesses. It enables companies to better understand customers’ needs, deliver targeted differentiated messaging, communicate via appropriate channels, and optimize marketing spend.

In my report I am describing the step-by-step process of a Customer Segmentation analysis and how it can be effective in building customer personas. I am also addressing the data manipulation and pre-processing needs that enable more effective data analysis.
